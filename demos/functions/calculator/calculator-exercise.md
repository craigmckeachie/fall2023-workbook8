### Step-by-Step Guide: Simple Calculator Exercise

#### 1. **HTML Setup:**

- Create an HTML file named `index.html`.
- Set up the basic HTML structure with a form that includes:
  - Input fields for two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
  - A dropdown menu (`operation`) to select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - A button to trigger the calculation.
- Include a section to display the result.

#### 2. **JavaScript Functions:**

- Create a JavaScript file named `script.js`.
- Write separate functions for each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Each function should take two parameters (numbers) and return the result.
- Optionally, create a function to handle invalid inputs.

#### 3. **Calculate Function:**

- Write a function (`calculate`) that will be triggered when the user clicks the "Calculate" button.
- Inside this function:
  - Get user input from the HTML form (numbers and selected operation).
  - Call the appropriate arithmetic function based on the selected operation.
  - Update the result on the webpage.

#### 4. **Testing:**

- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Enter valid numbers in the input fields.
- Select an operation from the dropdown menu.
- Click the "Calculate" button and verify that the result is displayed correctly.
- Test with different numbers and operations to ensure the calculator functions as expected.

#### 5. **Optional Enhancements:**

- Implement error handling:
  - Check if the input is a valid number.
  - Display a message for invalid input.
- Improve the user interface with styling.
- Add additional arithmetic operations or functionalities.

#### 6. **Review and Refactor:**

- Review the code with the students.
- Discuss the concept of functions and parameters.
- Encourage students to experiment with the code, making small modifications and observing the changes.

#### 7. **Discussion:**

- Engage in a discussion about the importance of functions in organizing code and making it reusable.
- Discuss the role of parameters in allowing functions to work with different input values.
- Address any questions or challenges students encountered during the exercise.

#### 8. **Further Exploration:**

- Encourage students to explore additional JavaScript features, such as conditional statements or loops, to enhance the calculator or add new functionalities.
- Provide resources for further learning about JavaScript functions and best practices.
